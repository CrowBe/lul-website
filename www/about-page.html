        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            In 2005, while working for the original McGill family business The North Rocks Greenery,
            Jon McGill took on his first Garden Maintenance job armed with just a pair of secateurs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The business grew significantly, servicing Sydney's Hills District, and expanded to certified Landscaping services.
            The McGill family then re-branded the business after selling the Nursery before moving away from Garden Maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the new name, <span>Looking Up Landscapes </span>
            services Newcastle and the Hunter Valley through to Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast.
            The Landscaping teams are still managed by Jon, who now has well over a decade of experience and qualifications, and supported operationally by his wife Belinda.
