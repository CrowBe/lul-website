        <h4>Your Disclosures In Blogs And Other Social Media:</h4>
        <p>
            You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, 
            chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel or survey, may be viewed 
            and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using the 
            Service or any other online services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes.
        </p>

            including sharing such information with more third parties, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses.
            Your continued use of the Service and our services following the posting of any changes to this Australian Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.
